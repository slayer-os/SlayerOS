      Chiyo’s Creative Licensing Version 1
                         (CCLV1)

Copyright (C) [2025] [The SlayerOS Project]

This document declares that upon acquisition, the purchaser of any Media—be it software, creative content, or any form thereof—receives COMPLETE OWNERSHIP over that Media. Payment for access or consumption is recognized as an addition of full ownership rights, not merely a license to use the content.

                            PREAMBLE

Given rapid technological advancements and the continued importance of owning physical media, it is essential to redefine how consumers interact with creative works. Traditionally, payment only granted limited usage rights. This document proposes that buying media should confer full ownership. Additionally, as modern creative processes often involve reverse engineering, the nature of creative works is changing. This document argues that legally deconstructing and rebuilding a game or other media makes the resulting work entirely yours.

                          TERMS OF OWNERSHIP

0. Definitions.
   a) "Media" means any creative work covered by this document, including software, textual content, audio recordings, musical compositions, and any combination thereof, irrespective of its digital or physical form.
   b) "Source Media" denotes the original, preferred form of the Media suitable for analysis, modification, or transformation.
   c) "Modified Media" or "Derivative Work" refers to any work derived from the original Media, including that produced by reverse engineering or any other transformative process as well as any derivative works created from the Modified Media or Derivative Work by other parties.
